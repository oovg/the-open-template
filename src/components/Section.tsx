          It&apos;s an open secret, a scandalous bit of folk knowledge known
          among realists and parriahs alike, that the ones who seek totalizing
          systems are the ones most excluded from the touch of completion. A
          preliminary definition of truth for the modern age: that which an
          institution cannot see. One needs the vision of the outside, a place
          not so timely, to see that the project of administration, the distance
          of the template, is blind to the singularities - the traces of
          difference and happenstance which contain in their roughness the
          strange wholeness of the world.

          Concepts are a different story. They may appear to serve
          administration and ownership in little mercenary episodes, but they
          are always slipping toward free encounter and discovery, the trickster
          germ of the untimely. When Von Neumann and Wiener developed the field
          of cybernetics, they couldn&apos;t know that they were opening up a
          line of inquiry that would expose them, in their bids at control, to
          the open time of the earth. Bateson&apos;s information ecology:
          everywhere there is entanglement, recursion, the categorically
          unstable reflexivity of network systems, <i>there is the earth</i>: an
          unstoppable difference, burrowing unstable paths that revive the dead,
          deliver the unborn, an open machine for the production of new
          temporalities.

          Programming culture tells the same story, though perhaps on a
          different axis - the earthen silica of the computer leaping out of the
          bound to give emergence its voice. The open source movement
          discovered, in following the unruly openings of turing completion, the{' '}
          <i>bazaar</i>, a terrain too vast to contain (or to own). The flat
          ontology of engineering, where networks move faster than hierarchies
          and nothing is sacred. It was a wisdom gained by work, beyond all
          ideological discipline, beyond abstraction and theology, and because
          of that, it necessarily pointed past the institution.

          Cryptography enabled that intuition, allowing it to be realized as an
          infrastructure. What are the local minima of institutional constructs?
          What anarchistic stop-gaps across time and space might nonetheless
          enable legibility in what Moten and Turing both called{' '}
          <i>The Universal Machine</i>? The builders of web3 were a recursive
          public: the product of their work embodied the protocols of their own
          development. They built in ambulant guilds of free association, an
          ethic of encounter developed solely to expose each node to that
          machine - the non-institutional charge, emergence, the rough
          wholeness. In the infrastructure of the cryptographic ledger is the
          promise of a society of friends - free encounter among entities under
          non-coercive conditions, for the earth is magnetically repelled by the
          atmosphere of coercion. Supremacy is a dead ecology.

          in 1853 of the tradition of the gothic masons, journeyman
          practitioners whose art contained the generic traits of free
          association and encounter with the earth (&ldquo;in gothic
          work,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the workman must have been altogether set
          free&rdquo;). The traits are as follows:{' '}
          <b>
            Savageness or Rudeness, Love of Change, Love of Nature, Disturbed
            Imagination, Obstinacy
          </b>
          , and <b>Generosity</b>. The brash artistry had no time for ceremony
          and manicured likenesses, generating “creations of ungainly shape and
          rigid limb, but full of wolfish life.” The successive builds made for
          patchwork styles that embraced changed; the spires and buttresses
          charged with an obstinance and rigidity “not merely stable, but active
          … the peculiar energy which gives tension to movement, and stiffness
          to resistance, which makes the fiercest lightning forked rather than
          curved.”

          In the ethos of free work is a negotiation, a pact where the audacity
          of liberty is checked by the patience of emergence. The journeyman
          makes acquaintance with the networked earth. “The love of change which
          becomes morbid and feverish in following the haste of the hunter and
          the rage of the combatant, is at once soothed and satisfied as it
          watches the wandering of the tendril, and the budding of the flower. …
          The sculptor who sought for his models among the forest leaves, could
          not but quickly and deeply feel that complexity need not involve the
          loss of grace, nor richness that of repose.” The gothic labors are
          distinct for this naturalism, this realism, built out of “a profound
          sympathy with the fulness and wealth of the material universe.”

          In the memelore and production of the builders of the decentralized
          web, we find these same attributes. We find the savage grasp of
          materiality - yes, even the materiality of transistor charges and
          logic gates - loved and embraced for all its robustness. When the
          relationship to the elements isn&apos;t alienated by the distracted
          and antireal metaphysics of hierarchy, that abundance unfolds, so that
          the intention of the producer is fused with the intrigue and chance of
          the material instance. That&apos;s the question- how can we bring the
          material instance to bear in building, conceptualizing, and
          manifesting the flamboyantly fractal and utterly irreverent scale
          invariance of the network, the (anti)thing that touches and ignites
          the rough whole? In work is an imaginatively sober play.

          Borrowing from the ethos of the builders, we announce The Open
          Machine, a publication press for the advancement of concepts adequate
          to the network. We forego authority and professionalism for
          nonlinearity and free association. We call to task interdisciplinary
          and transhistorical inputs for the sake of conceptual pandemonium. We
          study the rhythms and arrows of meme propagation so as to venture
          farther out onto limbs of recursion and emergence. We work through the
          abandonment issues of those that have forsaken the lords of enclosure
          and find new idols, machine elves and mathematical witches of the open
          past and the long future.

          We create in an atmosphere of savageness and generosity. We view the
          expanse with the disturbed eye of reality. Atop the flat bazaar, we
          build an untimely cathedral, a mayhem of free successions that might
          iterate off into the outer spaces, legibility in non-institutional
          time.
