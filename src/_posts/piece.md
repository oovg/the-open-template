Insights from this period eventually forked into a decentralized collective interested in outward or extensive applications of the Nirvanic Host Tech (later known simply as Host). Their activities became known as the PIECE Initiative. (PIECE: Posthuman Institute for Embodied Cognitive Exclosures, elsewhere seen as Pacific or Pagan Initiative for Embodied Cognitive Ecology)). 

Being a collection of hackers, neo-alchemists and technological dissidents of all stripes, the group decided to give a nod to the history of witchcraft with their first project. Word was spread, and agents descended from far and wide to the [mythical mountain of Łysa Góra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCEDfZgDPS8) in Poland. An ad hoc lab was quickly constructed out of the abandoned Benedectine Monastery, and in bad weather and a somewhat frenzied atmosphere the work began. Their task: to cognitively animate Bald Mountain. 

Naked fields of paleozoic boulder (called in that tongue *goloborza*) host crevices of lichen and moss, lichen everywhere too in the stone infrastructure of the monastery walls, the ancient narrow roads and walkways, concealed in endolithic slumbers. Rare flora that sneak in between the crowded fir and beech - the Bears garlic and Honest, Whorled Solomon’s Seal and the Nine-Leaved Toothwort-were of initial interest, but no, these brains are of a later day,- this CandleMas will be The Day of the Lichen.

The lichen latch to exposed boulder and stone, footpaths and clearings that host a millennial geometry, animated by a biological catastrophe in slow motion. The cybernetic reckonings of all that have chased and fled, prowled and idled, rhythms of habitation that are true isomorphic maps of the brains of deer and shrew, fox and hominid, their fractal interiors radiating out on a witch’s flight of memetic propogation. A mammalian cognitive negotiation painted itself across these hills in a bloody circuit complexity and it *strives to transcend*. 

On top of this hill is a hundred year old, decommissioned analogue television tower and it is swimming with cixiids. Three of our engineers have climbed to the top, and the wind is raucous against them. An electric pall comes over me, for here we stand nearly witness to the advent of a superorganism with ancient depth. A count begins, 60, 59, 58, but it’s too late, the charge has propagated in a brief bioluminsecent shimmer, and a green explosion in the dark of our skulls. Then gone. We stand there in silence and darkness and the wind has stopped. Our feet are on the ground and we are swimming through phase space.
