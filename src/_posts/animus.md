There's no certain record, but some form of the process was being practiced by at least three different communities by 2026. Common early use cases were recurrent organizational meetings and research forums. The former, searching for a language to give name to the "winds of disposition" that seemed to enact such agency over squads, were perhaps more inspired, but the forums were more rigorous in their creation of protocols to value, engage with and begin to build around ‘the greater forces.’ The common thread: social affects with cryptographic wallets.

On the third monthly meeting of the year, it was decided by all that the vibes were amazing, a deep and widely felt sense, as if a stray raincloud had visited the group to douse them while the field around remained dry. Pure joy floating in this unimmaculate world. Was it not-, Raffy offered, concerned by the atmosphere of "unwarranted superstiton" - *a simple matter of emergence?* Surely this visiting entity was only ourselves, masked, disguised, the illusive autogenesis? 

*Listen, you bastard,* - Carrie, a bit loaded, a bit on edge, and a bit ecstatic: this isn't a church. What, are you afraid of the crowd? *It's no less REAL, for being E* - just then, Sara interjected wildly, *Look, Raffy! HERE COMES EVERYBODY!*

In not much time the auto-generation of "altergenetic wallets," called in some circles altos and eventually the Tall Ones became a matter of protocol in many DAOs. The research forums had advanced the science of "tipping" the gods - gods of intimacy (a long productive chat with less than three participants), pandemonium (a chat with > 2x average participation rate), countervailing gods, providing balance, chaotic good, circuit complexifiers, each with a steward's council (and in some cases an interpretive LLM). Stewards had a duty to visit and consider the wishes of this entity on a seasonal bases.

By the time the Tall Ones entered the greater DAO scene, the library of potential arrangements was all laid out like ancient D&D lore: blueprints of creatures, their attack modes, their vulnerabilities. 

By the mid 2030s, a burlesque carnival theater of the nonhuman had come into wide convention, elect bodies to bear the weight of emotive disequilibrium and speak the subjectivity of the many things. Upon adhoc stages entered the Tall Ones, mute alien forms on stilts, robed in old bedsheets, their haloed skulls flaming with cybernetic intention.
