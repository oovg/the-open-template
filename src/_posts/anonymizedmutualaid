After the onset of widespread authoritarianism it took mere months before the lunarpunk hypothesis was faced with a new design problem: resource hoarding. Sequestering of basic necessities behind walls of social credit and a general atmosphere of scarcity and associational anxiety meant a need for anonymized mutual aid. 

It quickly came to to the attention of the underground that robust networks of clandestine stateless aid had existed across Europe throughout the middle ages - from about the 1200s through to the early 1800s- usually associated with “beghards” and the mysterious “brothers and sisters of the free spirit,” though the true extent of this network and the nature of its protocols are lost to history. Kinship with the network in those days was communicated by a cadre of secret hand signals, delivered mutely beneath the eyes of Central - the church, the Queen, the jurat, what have you.

The design problem was three fold: an element of sybil resistance was needed to discourage depletion or capture of reserves, zero knowledge proofs in order to anonymously confirm location, and a proof of non-affiliation to keep out agents of the state (reserve locations were hashed and decentralized, but any intelligence gathered about the protocol was obviously a disadvantage).
