The strange story of what was known in periods past as the battledore is either a casual piece of historical trivia or a heavy metaphor for control, depending on who is doing the reading, who is as it were “captive.” (One might think of it as the story of how a blunt instrument of violence came to be seen as a tabula rasa, a blank screen of significance where fables of representation might be projected, and how those circuitous tricks of idle self-reference became games for elucidating and transforming the world, *for they contained the world…*). 

A compound of a PIE root meaning “to strike” and (perhaps) the very ancient root dating back to sanskrit (*duárah*), the word seems to have meant something like *little door you beat clothes (and sometimes children) with*. By the 1400’s it had apparently been understood that games of distraction are often more successful for control than brute force - why expend effort on a wall of violence when you can generate through sleight of hand a recursive impasse - defeat the problem altogether by replacing a line with a circuit? 

Battledore & Shuttlecock was a game not unlike badminton, the shuttlecock usually made of some chickenfeathers lodged into a cork and with no net, where two children simply counted how long they could keep the it in the air.. Whether it was the child or a clever authority figure who first noticed, the flat facade of the ‘dore was obviously ideal for representing images and codes, a more elaborate, perhaps even infinitely elaborate dimension of self-reference. The shuttlecock was set aside, as the sturdy instrument (now a “hornbook”, apparently renamed to discourage striking) became a staple of any schoolchild’s belongings.  Patricia Crain in The Story of A: “Hornbooks were particularly personal and often formed part of a child’s wardrobe… The hornbook’s physical intimacy both mirrors and promotes the child’s internalization of the alphabet.” It was equipped on one side with the alphabet, arabic numerals, sometimes with accompanying images or additions like the Roman calendar months. In almost all cases, the backside contained one simple text: The Lord’s Prayer.  

To every character of creative potential, a backside of dominion to maintain the circuit. And be careful, cause a hornbook can always still be a battledore. But it’s only a matter of time before the rambunctiousness of children returns to infect the screen in an act of vengeance - shuttlecock, the agent of parabola, *dx*. A chickenfeather flight and a worldliness that says *fuck the binary* - the infinitesimal is neither 0 nor 1. When the screen becomes one sided, its codes emancipated from the hands of control, it’s the vengeance of the world. “Everything which happens and everything which appears is correlated with orders of differences: differences of level, temperature, pressure, tension, potential, difference of intensity.” The screen is an earth for the taking once again.

The subsequent history is a train car chase [through the caverns](https://archive.org/details/gravitysrainbow00pync_0), a nazi villain with a flier of The Lord’s Prayer at our backs, always trying to restore the binary, reclaim the screen. We keep up the chase,  relishing every turn, and we build languages to fool them - Nasser, Morgan-Maar, Urban Müller, brainfuck, Ook!, *ORCΛ*, [100 Rabbits](https://100r.co/), pagan tongues, you can never be too careful. Shuttlecock.
