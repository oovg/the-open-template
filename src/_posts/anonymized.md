After the onset of the social credit system in the American midwestern sectors, it took mere months before the lunarpunk hypothesis was faced with a new design problem: resource hoarding. Basic necessities sequestered behind walls of government sanction, attached to esoteric metrics of accord with the conservative politics of the regional austerity. The sinister digital authoritarian twist on the great American supermarket, combined with the general atmosphere of scarcity and associational anxiety of the age of "change" all factored into the need for a crytpographically secure, anonymized mutual aid infrastructure.

It quickly came to to the attention of the underground that robust networks of clandestine stateless aid had existed across Europe throughout the middle ages - from about the 1200s through to the early 1800s- usually associated with “beghards” and the mysterious “brothers and sisters of the free spirit,” though the true extent of this network and the nature of its protocols are lost to history. Kinship with the network in those days was communicated by a cadre of secret hand signals, delivered mutely beneath the eyes of Central - the church, the Queen, the jurat, what have you.

The design problem was three fold: an element of sybil resistance was needed to discourage depletion or capture of reserves, zero knowledge proofs in order to anonymously confirm location, and a proof of non-affiliation to keep out agents of the state (reserve locations were hashed and decentralized, but any intelligence gathered about the protocol was obviously a disadvantage).
