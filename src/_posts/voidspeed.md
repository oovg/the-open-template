Referring to an absence of bounded speed limits, an infinite speed lacking any disparity of distance or individuation. the light may think and feel as if it is the void, or even as emanent to the void, but it is always lacking the infinite connection of the void; the ability to traverse realities at voidspeed.

The void may take a seat on the catbus of the universe and one may wonder _"Who drives the bus"?_ But the void can step in and out of being the driver and the passenger; the bus itself. the void travels at voidspeed; connected to everything, everywhere, all at once; unbounded by the limits of lightspace; feeling itself through the full potentialities of the void.
