The penultimate sentences of Mikhail Bakhtin’s great study, *Rabelais and His World* are as follows: *We repeat, every act of world history was accompanied by a laughing chorus. But not every period of history had Rabelais for coryphaeus.*

“The laughing chorus”, a figure of critique, agency and the right to exit. Of course there’s no boss (not even Rabelais). The gesture to that fugitive public’s director evolved from taunt to riddle to mysticism. It was a code of dissent, a network gatepass: *Where’s coryphaeus*? First recorded on chain in 2034, hexidecimal message of flight: “*Ragequit. See Coryphaeus.*” What was at first an irreverent literary chide evolved into a respect for the mystery of the mass gestalt combined with the conviction that there is nonetheless a center of gravity, a wisdom of freedom, a seat for it. A spacetime, a fabric accent, a *character*. 

The egregore of course rode a witch’s flight of its own, demon portrayals, towering stacks of self-reference almost falling under their own weight. Generative art and street tags of the clown general, the lightfooted daemon, the apophatic code or the floating afterlife of an abandoned smart contract - so potent with life is the absence. Satan himself, not nihilism but Exit, the very meme of dissent and the devilish faith, leading the pack from behind, that the laughing chorus will somehow somewhere get out.
