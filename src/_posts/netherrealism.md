Netherrealism, not to be confused with pre-Inovarian quantism, as a philosophy seeks to resolve the tension of reciprocal causality of the relational uncertainties between a nether and ether, antiversal and universal substrates, a synthesis into a new view of super-reality. From the netherrealist perspective, all observed universality is a result of two layers of probabilities dancing with one another that, once entangled, result in a layer of real typically considered by realism in the material world. This relational manifold of non-linear, non-local differentials has brewed many new forms of certainty reduction, fully manifested and observed in the material. Though a budding new philosophy, first elucidated in 2046 by Trea Inovar, its practitioners have proven to present new forms of energy relationships that other ways of thinking have failed to reproduce, leading realists to resort to labeling it a form of surreal magicka. Used as an affront to netherrealism, the surreal qualia is actually accepted as one of many phasic realities, non-purely imagined.

How might we transduce such uncertainties?
