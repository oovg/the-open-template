Automatic writer and alleged feminist language poet Hannah Weiner  (1928- Sept 11, 1997) was known in her time for championing a kind of avant garde word art, accentuated with a collaborative performance protocol that turned private pain into collective catharsis. They were deeply private scenes putting her severe schizophrenic symptoms on full display (ultrareal alphabetic hallucinations, a kind of direct visual manifestation exceedingly rare in the archives). 

Often her poems and performances were accompanied with [forthright](https://sites.evergreen.edu/thewordintheear-fall/wp-content/uploads/sites/316/2014/09/Clairvoyant_Journal_Weiner.pdf) declarations like "*I SEE words on my forehead   IN THE AIR    on the typewriter   on the page*". But they were strangely impersonal. Moreso when presented as stage acts with a league of women- usually three or four but sometimes up to a dozen speaking through each other in [impressively fluid stream of conscious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF0IoXUGkKU). They seemed to reveal, especially to the captive audiences of the late 2020’s, a glacial uproar behind the cool rationality of the logos, a monstrous fugue of affects - shrieks of submission, mean terrors, the backsweat furies somehow invisible to our daily decoding. Not to Hannah’s.

What of this veil, this contract, where the words skate across but never seem to penetrate the gate?

In the long cultural reflection of her work the American DAOs came to refer to this subliminal object as THE PACT, a proto-concept to inform the later experiments in the Ukrainian federations of semantic-oriented conviction voting, streaming micro-intentions toward a vast array of LLM generated neosigs, strange hybrids of PIE or Phoenician phomenes that wiped the slate clean, let the furies breath…

Weiner had become a literal face of the radical DAO scene in the early 2030's, when hologram avatar recreations of her live readings were deployed as a kind of aesthetic terrorism throughout the Territories (alt-right or cryptofacist sovereignties erected in the wake of the period of federal austerity after 8/28). Picture a group of old boys in dated Trump hats walking by shaking their heads as three 1977 holographic Greenwich Village lesbians in housewife-smock drag stand on their street corner chain smoking and trading words, confrontationally inflected with the auras of patriarchy:  “CALL RAYMOND a storewith that across the door, $5 antique chair WORTH CUT OBEY MONDAY Why did pronoun see RHYS CHATHAM across the entrance to *a store* sort of an erased money I RHYS doesn't call but *safe* does see a big DONT in the air can't meet *home not on time* later ROSEMARY CALLS DONTWALKTONIGHT DO TTALK YOUSEEWORDS Comehome *see* YOU'RE BEA TIFUL FIRST COMMENT YOU'RE A PRONOUN … Went to 82 Club *wild direction dont call* extreme after Phil's concert *beautiful* a party NOT PHILS very confused energy the words were all unpleasant *continuous I'm tired* THA T'S WHY felt awful *concentrate* SECRET see GO TO PHIL's *embrace* Niblock on my forehead, go T ALK TO BARBARA Phil's wife see DRINK YOU MILK outside their door SEE.” They planted the scenes *everywhere*, using complex refraction techniques to conceal the source. A territorial police division noted fifty-seven separate avatar clusters in September of 2032. 

In this way Weiner became legend in decentralized communities the world over, her work understood (consciously or not) to represent a potential for solidarity in mysterious new configurations that exhausted the formalizations of the previous age and put up into open sight the very mechanism of domination. The infrared mist of legitimacy, pact, the contract made visible. My name is Hannah Weiner and I SEE WORDS.
