We are all victims of victims, and there is too much pain to justify retaliation.

When humanity was once again burning itself, in active delusions of revenge, a practice began to emerge from the ashes.

Like the members of MolochDAO named themselves after their nemesis, we started looking for opportunities to express love for ourselves and our fellow humans and called it guillotine. Instead of decapitation, removing face and mind, we encourage habits of awareness and consciousness.

When we brew tea and listen to a friend’s personal stories, that’s guillotine. When we participate in cooperative governance, optimizing for the most vulnerable, that’s guillotine. When we contribute our talents and skills towards a project that benefits future generations, even when we’re offered compromising roles with larger financial incentives, that’s guillotine.

When we treat our family with compassion, knowing that they can only love us in the way that they know how, not necessarily in the way that we would prefer, we learn that we can treat our fellow humans, and ourselves, with the same compassion.

Continually discovering love is guillotine.
